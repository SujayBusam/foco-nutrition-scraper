This is a small project that helps youÂ keep track of your food
consumption at FOCO and relates you statistics about the macronutrients
you've taken in 

It scrapes the nutrition menu from FOCO and outputs how many calories,
protein etc, you've consumed throughout the day.

***
PROBLEM:
  I'm lifting at the gym and I want to understand how much food I'm
consuming and their macronutrient content to gain weight efficiently. 

  



*** 
DONE: 
  - Scrape nutrition of one food item

TO DO:
  - Reverse engineer how to loop through the foods and grab ALL The
nutrition information
  - Create some UI to display the foods
  - Add an empty box
  - Add a scheduling feature that is like a "food diary". Should act
like some daily journal so that I can track how much macronutrients I
take and how many calories I'm consuming. 
  

****
POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS: 
  - Start sorting by interesting macronutrient combinations. Like what
is the highest calorie to protein ratio?
