This is a small project that helps youÂ keep track of your food
consumption at FOCO and relates you statistics about the macronutrients
you've taken in 

Follow progress at http://deloschang.blogspot.com/

It scrapes the nutrition menu from FOCO and outputs how many calories,
protein etc, you've consumed throughout the day.

PROBLEM:
  I'm lifting at the gym and I want to understand how much food I'm
consuming and their macronutrient content to gain weight efficiently.
